# amacrine - Hughes’ Amacrine Cell Data

## Description
Austin Hughes’ data: a point pattern of displaced amacrine cells in the retina of a rabbit. A marked point pattern.

## Usage
data(amacrine)

## Format
An object of class "ppp" representing the point pattern of cell locations. Entries include
- x Cartesian x-coordinate of cell
- y Cartesian y-coordinate of cell
- marks factor with levels off and on  
indicating “off” and “on” cells

## Notes
Austin Hughes’ data: a point pattern of displaced amacrine cells in the retina of a rabbit. 152 “on” cells and 142 “off” cells in a rectangular sampling frame. The true dimensions of the rectangle are 1060 by 662 microns. The coordinates here are scaled to a rectangle of height 1 and width 1060/662 = 1.601 so the unit of measurement is approximately 662 microns.  
The data were analysed by Diggle (1986).
